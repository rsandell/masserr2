#Management System for Servicing Roles and Resources 

A system for Storytellers hosting a Mind's Eye Theatre (MET) campaign.
With a bunch of house rules on character creation and influence systems.

Version one of the system was a mix of local java app and a web app with jsp and velocity. 
with a ms access database in the backend.
It is now time to space it up for the latest world of ever connected laptops and spartphones.

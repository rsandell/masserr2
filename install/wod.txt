Of course the font version doesn't look as good as the real versions, but some look reasonably good, others like the Wraith glyphs were too complicated to add.

To install the font unzip into a Temp directory then goto C:\Windows\Fonts and choose File -->Install New Font and point out where the temp directory where the WoD font is and highlight the font and then make sure the "Copy Fonts to font folder" is checked and click ok. and you can delete the temporary files, but you may want to keep this file since this has the character list :)

<h1>Morality Paths</h1>
<p class="default">
The Embrace strips a fledgling vampire of all ties to life and humanity. Turned
into an animated mockery of life that subsists on the blood of others, the new
vampire can only hope to hang onto some memory of mortal morality. The feelings
of compassion, the ineffable tie to life, trust and love are all cast aside by a curse that
separates the vampire from the rest of humanity. With all human drives and desires
twisted into a raging Beast that demands survival at any cost, only a code of morality
stands between the Cainite and utter animalistic insanity.
</p>
<p class="default">
Most vampires, thrust suddenly into undead society, cling to the trappings of their
mortal lives. This Humanity guides vampires to control their urges and to hang on to
the shadows of their former consciences. Indeed, many vampires, suddenly terrified by
the Hunger, hold themselves to higher standards in death than in life. However, as the
ages pass, emotions fade and Cainites become jaded, their Humanity flickering like a
dying candle. The Humanity of the most ancient of elders hangs only by a thread, and
many lose their Humanity entirely, falling into a final grand dance of frenzy and
slaughter until they are put down like rabid dogs by their fellow Kindred. As a vampire
loses her Humanity, she comes to resemble a pallid, desiccated corpse and is driven
more by her vampire habits: sleeping deeply during the day, giving in to the lassitude
of age and finding it difficult to interact with mortals as anything other than prey.
</p>
<p class="default">
A rare few vampires have the presence of mind to set for themselves moral standards
alien to humanity. As long as the Cainite holds to a rigid code of conduct, the Beast can be
kept at bay. Such a restructuring ofone's lifetime of morals requires incredible will and many
years of dedicated study. Over the centuries, vampires have developed several such alternate
moralities, called Paths of Enlightenment. These Paths cast aside all that is humane in favor
of aspecialized code more appropriate to the undead. Needless to say, despite their stabilizing
affect, these Paths are sociopathic - indeed, their practitioners are unquestionably divorced
from anything resembling mortal thought or belief. A follower of a Path may channel his
vampire urges, but such channels cause instinctive fear and revulsion in mortals.
</p>
<p class="default">
When you create a vampire character, you default to the morality of Humanity.
Your Morality Traits can range from zero to five, with zero Traits indicating that the
character has fallen completely to the clutches of the Beast (and is thus no longer
suitable for play) and five indicating a character with a highly developed sense of
morality. With the permission of a Storyteller, you can start with a Path of
Enlightenment, but keep in mind that Paths are difficult and demanding to roleplay.
To study a Path, your character must have at least three Willpower Traits, and he
must have spent several years abandoning Humanity in favor of a new set of morals
(with instruction). Paths also sometimes use different Virtues, and you may not start
with as many Virtue Traits if you have <i>Conviction</i> or <i>lnstinct</i> (since it takes work to
strip away your human virtues in favor of these inhuman ones).
</p>
<p class="default">
Each Path (including Humanity) has a Hierarchy of Sins. This Hierarchy elaborates
on what constitutes a moral failing for its particular set of ethics. The higher the rating,
the stricter the standards. Everything below that rating is automatically considered a
failing if performed. Thus, a rare vampire with a Humanity of 5 doesn't need to grapple
with his conscience over the notion that killing someone is wrong -he already knows
that. He does, however, have qualms about putting himself first too often.
</p>
<p class="default">
A character with several Morality Traits is distanced from the Beast, but
conversely, he must hold himself to high standards of behavior, as shown by the
many possible sins. With few Morality Traits, a character risks succumbing to the
Beast, but trivial moral concerns are too minor to erode his morals further. The
details of Morality Traits and Virtue Tests appear on p.108-111.
</p>
<p class="default">
The Paths of Enlightenment in this book are often found among non-aligned
vampires, or among a few vampires of any sectarian allegiance. Camarilla vampires usually
uphold Humanity, though a rare few elders follow different beliefs. Vampires of the Sabbat
have their own inhuman Paths of Enlightenment, which are a subject for another book.
</p>

<p class="default">
The majority of vampires default to Humanity. Even the depraved vampires of
the Sabbat and the jaded elders of the Camarilla cling to some vestige of Humanity,
though such monsters usually have very few Humanity Traits.
</p>
<p class="default">
 The ethics of Humanity uphold what constitutes humane behavior: Humanity
warns against stealing, killing, harming others or behaving selfishly.
</p>
<p class="default">
 Humanity Five - Kindred with a score this high can be, ironically, more human
than other humans. Many fledgling vampires cling to their moral codes more strictly
as a reaction against the new predator roiling in them. Though not necessarily treacly
sweet or passive, these Kindred have excruciatingly high standards for themselves and
often hold clearly defined concepts of right and wrong.
</p>
<p class="default">
Humanity Four -Theft is wrong. Murder or harming others is wrong. But sometimes
the speed limit is just too damn slow. Vampires at this level are approximate to "normal"
social morals, and are on par with most of mortal society. The vampire is concerned with
the natural rights of others, but there's some natural selfishness mixed in.
</p>
<p class="default">
Humanity Three - People Die. Stuff Breaks. This vampire has little difficulty
with the fact that she is a predator. While she won't always go out of her way to
vandalize or kill, she accepts that sometimes fate has it in for some people. She does
what needs doing with little griping or effort on her part to avoid it. Something of
the vampire's inner monster starts to shine through at this stage, causing mortals to
feel uncomfortable around her or manifesting some physical eeriness.
</p>
<p class="default">
Humanity Two - Hey, some people ought to die. Killing is very acceptable to
this Kindred, provided the victim deserves to die (and only the vampire knows who's
deserving). Theft, injury, torture and destruction are tools to be used to accomplish
one's goals, and one's goals are always paramount. Such a state reflects many vampire
elders. The vampire begins to acquire a corpselike aspect, and may find it difficult to
interact with mortals (who often find him more than a little disturbing).
</p>
<p class="default">
 Humanity One -The lives and property ofothers mean nothing to a Kindred this
far gone. Such a vampire more than likely indulges in twisted pleasures, which can be
all manner of atrocity. Perversion, cold-blooded murder, mutilation, wickedness for its
own sake are all signs of a Kindred who has not long to continue. The next frenzy may
well be the last. Such a vampire may be physically mistaken for human, but only under
certain conditions (such as dim lighting and plenty of distractions).

<p class="default">
Studied by the Assamites, this Path espouses a connection to Haqim, founder of
the clan, through the power of blood. Vampires on this Path hunt down other Cainites,
drinking their blood in order to improve their own potency. Those few who evidence
distaste for their condition or hatred for the "Get of Khayyin" (descendants of Caine)
mav be offered the opportunity to convert, to serve the will of Haqim in his battle
against Khayyin's evil childer. By diablerizing their enemies and holding a loof from
other Cainites, the students of the Path of Blood seek to overcome the blot of Khayyin's:
curse and redeem themselves in a transcendence awash in stolen vitae.
</p>
<p class="default">
The so-called Dervishes hunt for lore and ancient vitae, so that they may understand
theirenemiesand take theirpower. EvenCainitesofweakblood arenot immune tothe hunts;
the Dervishes are said to have ways of mystically preserving the vitae so that other members
of their clan can use it. By stealing away the power of other vampires, the Dervishes hope to
concentrate it in the hands of the faithful, who purify it through their honor.
</p>
<p class="default">
 Only old and faithful Assamites, andafew converts, study the PathofBlood. Most outsiders
and neonates are completely ignorant of this Path. Instruction begins only when the supplicant
proves his worth and his desire to be shed of Khayyin's curse in the light of Haqim's glory.
Students of the Path of Blood practice <i>Conviction</i> and <i>Self-control</i>.

<h2><a name="The Path of Bones">The Path of Bones</a></h2>
<img src="paths/bones.gif" alt="Path of Bones Hierarchy of Sins" align="center">
<p class="default">
As walking corpses, vampires truly exist on the cusp of mortality. Death comes to all
things sooner or later, so the Gravediggers study the process of physical death, the decay of
the body and the extinguishing of the spirit. Practiced largely by Giovanni and some Samedi,
these scholarly Cainites strive to unlock the mysteries of death, to understand why death
occurs and how vampires cheat the natural cycle. Though they are neither murderers nor
cavalier about death, they do occasionally "assist" if death seems to be unnaturally delayed.
</p>
<p class="default">
  Necromantic curiosity drives followers of the Path of Bones to seekout experiments
and hidden lore about death. Many consort with ghosts, trying to discern the very
motives of the soul. To a Gravedigger, the vampire cheats eternity. The answers to how
and why this happens hold the keys to understanding all of mortality, and thus, to all
existence. While the Gravediggers may be quite erudite about ghosts and thanatology,
many are completely divorced from society, mortal or Cainite.
</p>
<p class="default">
The Path of Bones upholds <i>Conviction</i> and <i>Self-control</i>.

<h2><a name="The Path of Metamorphisis">The Path of Metamorphisis</a></h2>
<img src="paths/metamorphisis.gif" alt="Path of Metamorphisis Hierarchy of Sins" align="center">
<p class="default">
Long have the Carpathian Fiends studied the ways of the flesh. Through <i>Vicissitude</i>,
they twist themselves into new visages until they do not have arecognizable gender or even
look remotely human. True Metamorphosists, though, aim not to shock but to evolve. Just
asvampires aresuperior to humans, they claim, there is another state superior tovampirism.
By controlling the physical flesh and learning the ways of the body, they hope to cause spirit
and mind to follow suit, turning into something beyond vampire.
</p>
<p class="default">
In keeping with their practices, the Metamorphosists are solitary and cold. Reason,
experimentation and self-discipline are the keystones to improvement. Each individual must
find the secret keys to her own existence. As such, the students of the Path of Metamorphosis
individually chart disparate paths leading to that state above and beyond vampirism.
</p>
<p class="default">
The Path of Metamorphosis teaches <i>Conviction</i> and <i>Instinct</i>.
</p>
<h2><a name="The Path of Night">The Path of Night</a></h2>
<img src="paths/night.gif" alt="Path of Night Hierarchy of Sins" align="center">
<p class="default">
Vampires are monsters, claim the Nihilists, and as such, they embody all of the
terrible sins of the world. Since vampires serve a place in the greater scheme of
existence, the evil of vampirism must be preordained. Thus, instead of simply giving
in to the Beast, adherents of the Path of Night seek to spread their evil in cultivated
ways, tempting people to damnation and terrifying the faithless. By acting as an
agent of evil, the vampire fulfills his role to higher powers.
</p>
<p class="default">
A vampire on the Path of Night is not a ravening, insane beast. He seeks to show
the true depth of evil to others, luring them into vice and highlighting virtue by its
opposite. These vampires plague humanity with all manner of terrors and temptations,
seeking not only mortal fears but their own escalation as dark angels. By spreading the
taint, the vampire hopes to fulfill a preordained destiny, and thus to eventually move on.
</p>
<p class="default">
The Path of Night teaches <i>Conviction</i> and <i>Instinct</i>.

<h2><a name="The Path of Paradox">The Path of Paradox</a></h2>
<img src="paths/paradox.gif" alt="Path of Paradox Hierarchy of Sins" align="center">
<p class="default">
Espousing riddles that delve into the illusory nature of existence, the Ravnos
followers of the Path of Paradox seek to fulfill the demands of karma. By testing
others (often with traps or riddles), the Shilmulo determine each person's place in
the wheel of ages. Once the veils of the transitory material world are cast aside, the
philosopher can lead the subject to his proper place in destiny - even death.
</p>
<p class="default">
Kindred are believed to be locked outside of maya (the cycle of the universe). While
most individuals are reincarnated through sarnsara, the way of rebirth, vampires have
dodged this cycle. Therefore, they have also lost their swadham, or individual purpose.
Thus, it remains to the Shilmulo to determine each vampire's svadham and get him back
on that path, thus advancing maya, by whatever means necessary. If other Kindred fail to
understand their swadham, then it's up to the Ravnos to push them back into samsara. The
state of undeath is considered acurse, but Ravnos believe this shruti (what has been learned
from the gods) to be due to their failure to understand maya. Only by weaving illusions
themselves can they hope to tear away the veils that hide the Ultimate Truths.

<h2><a name="The Path of Typhon">The Path of Typhon</a></h2>
<img src="paths/typhon.gif" alt="Path of Typhon Hierarchy of Sins" align="center">
<p class="default">
Set himself is said to lie in wait in the sands of Egypt. His followers, the Setites,
work diligently to spread his influence throughvice, favors and chains of ecstasy. Using
the desires of others for control, the Theophidians gather information about their
sleeping god, prepare agents for his return and seek the means to resurrect their deity.
</p>
<p class="default">
The Corrupters are mistrusted by other Cainites, and withgood reason. All Setites
keep their motives carefully hidden so that they might draw on the resources of their
hapless slaves without hindrance. After all, anally (unwitting or otherwise) whodoesnot
know one's plans cannot effectively counter them. To this end, the Corrupters weave
subtle webs ofcontrol, holding thernselves alooffrompetty indulgences while pandering
the innermost desires of others. With their religious rites in hidden temples, they offer
service and obedience to Set; through their carefully built chains of dependents, they
gather the occult secrets and services necessary to strengthen their clan and god.

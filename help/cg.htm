Merits and Flaws are meant to give your character that little extra twist
that sets him apart from the pack. They should always be the last step in
character creation and never the main focus of a character concept. Often,
new players will make the mistake of latching on to a Merit or Flaw and
defining a character solely by that small detail. The end result is rarely a
character that has enough depth or creativity to be worth playing for extended
periods of time.
</p>
<p class=default>
Likewise, many players will try and take as many Flaws as they can in order
to buy as many points of Generation, Abilities or Disciplines as possible. Bear
in mind that the Storyteller has every right to strip a Flaw (and its points) from
a character if it isn't being played properly. Flaws are handicaps that limit the
things a character can do. A Flaw that isn't a disadvantage isn't really a Flaw,
and shouldn't be treated as such.

<h2><a name="Physical">Physical</a></h2>
<h3><a name="Bruiser">Bruiser</a> (1 Trait Merit)</h3>
<p class=default>
The icy stare, the cobra eyes - you've got the stone cold thug look down,
and it works. You are one Trait up when comparing ties on any attempts to
intimidate someone.
</p>
<h3><a name="Friendly Face">Friendly Face</a> (1 Trait Merit)</h3>
<p class=default>
Don't I know you from somewhere?You have an open, honest look about you
that always seems to remind everyone of an old friend they haven't seen in years.
You are one Trait up on all attempts to persuade, seduce or beguile a stranger.
</p>
<h3><a name="Dulled Bite">Dulled Bite</a> (2 Trait Flaw)</h3>
<p class=default>
Your fangs never fully developed, or they never came in at all. When
feeding, you need to find some other way of making the blood flow, or must win
on a Physical Challenge (in addition to any necessary to grapple your victim)
in order for your bite to penetrate. A number of Caitiff and high-generation
vampires manifest this Flaw.
</p>
<h3><a name="Glowing Eyes">Glowing Eyes</a> (2 Trait Flaw)</h3>
<p class=default>
Your eyes actually glow in the dark, not merely reflecting light like a cat's,
but actually producing light. This radiation partially blinds you and, in the
dark, makes you stand out like a sore thumb. Likewise, your very presence in
public is a breach in the Masquerade. Only thick, wrap-around sunglasses will
hide this illumination-ordinary sunglasses or contact lenses just don't cut it.
You gain the following Negative Social Trait: Bestial and the Negative Mental
Trait: Obliuious, neither of which can be bought off with experience points.
However, you also gain the Social Trait: Intimidating for free. It is recommended
that you wear a tag proclaiming your unusual deformity.
</p>
<h3><a name="Permanent Fangs">Permanent Fangs</a> (2 Trait Flaw)</h3>
<p class=default>
Your fangs do not retract, making the preservation of the Masquerade
difficult at best. You must take the Negative Social Trait: <i>Bestial</i>, which cannot
be bought off with experience points.
</p>
<h2><a name="Mental">Mental</a></h2>
<h3><a name="Coldly Logical">Coldly Logical</a> (1 Trait Merit)</h3>
<p class=default>
You have a knack for separating fact from hysteria, truth from emotion.
Some may call you a cold fish, but you're too cool to care. You are one Trait
up when comparing ties on any attempt to persuade you using emotion (i.e.,
a Social Challenge where your opponent bids Traits like <i>Beguiling</i>, <i>Charismatic</i>
or <i>Seductive</i>).
</p>
<h3><a name="Thirst for Innocence">Thirst for Innocence</a> (2 Trait Flaw)</h3>
<p class=default>
The sight of innocence of any sort arouses a terrible hunger within you.
You must pass a <i>Self-Control</i> Test or else frenzy and attack the source of your
hunger.
</p>
<h3><a name="Guilt-Wracked">Guilt-Wracked</a> (4 Trait Flaw)</h3>
<p class=default>
You cannot cope with the fact that you must consume blood to survive.
You must pass a <i>Courage</i> Test each and every time you attempt to feed, or else
you simply cannot go through with it. This means you will often be low on
blood and will easily succumb to hunger frenzies.
</p>
<h2><a name="Supernatural">Supernatural</a></h2>
<h3><a name="Bright Aura">Bright Aura</a> (1 Trait Merit)</h3>
<p class=default>
For some reason, your aura reads as much brighter and more colorful than
most Kindred's. When you are the subject of <i>Aura Perception</i>, your character
appears mortal. This Merit is particularly appropriate for high-generation
vampires and Caitiff.
</p>
<h3><a name="Healing Touch">Healing Touch</a> (1 Trait Merit)</h3>
<p class=default>
Normally vampires can only heal wounds left from the Kiss by licking
them. With a touch, you can achieve the same effect.
</p>
<h3><a name="Healing Touch">Inoffensive to Animals</a> (1 Trait Merit)</h3>
<p class=default>
Animals generally fear and loathe the presence of the Kindred. The
predator fights and the prey flees when Caine's children approach. For some
reason, this does not hold true for you. Animals won't necessarily like you at
first sight, but they will not automatically flee from you.
</p>
<h3><a name="Cold Breeze">Cold Breeze</a> (1 Trait Flaw)</h3>
<p class=default>
A cold breeze follows you wherever you go. While this is terribly dramatic
around curtains and open flames, it also proclaims your supernatural aspect to
everyone around you, including mortals. You are one Trait down on any social
interaction with mortals. It is recommended that you wear a tag describing this
aspect of your character.
</p>
<h3><a name="Beacon of the Unholy">Beacon of the Unholy</a> (2 Trait Flaw)</h3>
<p class=default>
You radiate a palpable aura of evil. Clergy and mortals possessing True
Faith are instantly aware that you are a supernatural creature of darkness and
react accordingly. Likewise, you suffer the effects of True Faith when on holy
ground or any place of worship.
</p>
<h3><a name="Bound">Bound</a> (2 Trait Flaw)</h3>
<p class=default>
You begin the game bl'ood bound to another player's character or Storyteller
character. The knowledge that your will is not your own constantly
chafes at your soul, even as you revel in your utter love for your captor. This
Flaw may only be taken with the express permission of the Storyteller and, if
applicable, the player whose character to whom you are bound.
</p>
<h3><a name="Deathsight">Deathsight</a> (2 Trait Flaw)</h3>
<p class=default>
Everything appears to be dead and decaying around you. The world is a
corpse, mortals are walking cadavers, and everything is in ruins. You must take
the Negative Social Trait: <i>Callous</i> and the Negative Mental Trait: <i>Obliuious</i>,
neither of which can be bought off with experience points. On the other hand,
you are two Traits up when comparing Traits on any Social Challenge based on
physical appearance (i.e., your opponent bids the Traits <i>Gorgeous</i> or <i>Alluring</i>).
</p>
<h3><a name="Lord of the Flies">Lord of the Flies</a> (2 Trait Flaw)</h3>
<p class=default>
Buzzing, swarming insects constantly surround you. You are one Trait
down on any social or Stealth-related challenge. It is recommended that you
wear a tag announcing this aspect of your character.

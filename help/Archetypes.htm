<h1><a name="Archetypes">Archetypes</a></h1>

<p class="default">
Each Archetype describes an essential form of personality. Though a character
is more than a simple set of drives, an Archetype provides a basic springboard from
which the character's motives and behaviors can develop. An archetypal Nature
shows the underlying elements making up a personality, while archetypal Demeanor
is the face the character shows to the world around him.
</p>
<p class="default">
In game play, a character's Nature Archetype serves to provide concrete goals
and codes of behavior, which means that a character can call for a retest on a Virtue
Test automatically if a frenzy would violate the character's Nature. However, if
someone discovers your character's Nature, it can be used against you in the same
way a Negative Trait might be, forcing you into a challenge.
</p>
<p class="default">
<b>Example: </b><i>Ian, a Malkawian with a Fanatic Nature and a ferwent hatred of the Sabbat,
is leadingfive other Kindred against a maraudingpack. One of the pack brandishes a Molotow
cocktail at Ian, who tests for frenzy and fails. Howewer, Ian's player calls for a retest based
on Ian's Nature - he's too driven to let some showelhead punk fresh out of the ground try to
scare him with a cheap tactic. The player makes a second test and wins. Ian pauses only for
a moment at the sight of the Molotov before launching himself at the startled pack member.</i>
</p>
<p class="default"><i>
Later, Ian is wounded and winded, and the p'nce asks him to kad another charge. Ian is in
no shape to do so, and he refuses. The prince commands him angrily: "I am your prince and too
Commanding for you to refuse. " The prince then adds, "You're too much of a Fanatic, Ian, to
let these rabble run unchecked through the city." The prince's player calls for a Social Challenge,
and because he guessed Ian's Nature correctly , Ian'splayer must adwance two Traits. The challenge
is made, and Ian loses. Wearily, the Lunatic rises to his feet and prepares for the next assault.</i>

<p class="default">
Archetypes are the building blocks for your character's persona. In day-today
life, people put on different Demeanors as they face the world. You behave
like one sort of person at the office, another at school and maybe yet another
when out partying with your friends. None of these different faces we wear are
lies, exactly. But the deepest goals and motivations of a person - the
innermost Nature-are rarely on display for the entire world to see. When you
are building your character, you should ask yourself: What does this person
truly want? What face does he show to the world in order to get it?The answers
you come up with are the heart of any truly enjoyable character.
</p>
<p class="default">
There are some Archetypes that are very common in the Camarilla.
Certain clans are naturally drawn to grant these sort of people the Embrace.
Likewise, Kindred in important positions within the Camarilla are always
looking for servants of a certain temperament.

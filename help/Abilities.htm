<h1><a name="_abilities">Abilities</a></h1>

<p class=default>The
particular bits of knowledge learned over the years, the tricks of the trade
and the hard-won secrets of crafts are all abilities. A character's Ability
Traits represent special training or talent, and as such, they often allow
performance of tasks that would be otherwise impossible. Even with more mundane
situations, Abilities allow for a much improved chance of success.</p>

<p class=default>When a
character performs a risky or uncertain action, Abilities aid the outcome. If
you try a task and fail, you can temporarily expend one of your appropriate
Abilities, to gain an immediate retest. You lose the Ability used and the initial
Trait(s) bid for the task (if any) because you lost the initial test, but you
can still overcome the challenge. Abilities used like this are recovered at the
next game session.</p>

<p class=default>A character
with multiple levels in a given Ability is certainly more experienced ad
proficient than an individual with just one. Most characters will fall into one
to three levels of Ability; greater amounts are very rare, and anything beyond
five levels is almost certainly superhuman (and limited to elder vampires and
their ilk). The total level of Ability in a given field corresponds roughly to
the character's professional capabilities:</span></p>

<p class=default style='text-indent:65.2pt'><b>Competent</b> (Able to earn a living) </p>

<p class=default style='text-indent:65.2pt'><b>Professional</b> (Licensed, capable of supervision)</p>

<p class=default style='text-indent:65.2pt'><b>Journeyman</b> (Bachelor's degree or instructor) </p>

<p class=default style='text-indent:65.2pt'><b>Expert</b> (Master's degree or researcher) </p>

<p class=default style='text-indent:65.2pt'><b>Master</span></b> (Doctorate or true innovator) </p>

<p class=default>Some tasks
are simply too difficult, or they require too much skill, to be attempted by a
character without the requisite Abilities. The Storyteller may occasionally
require the possession or use of an Ability Trait to perform a specific task.
In this case, characters without the Ability, or who have already used all of
their levels of the Ability, cannot attempt the task at all. </p>

<p class=default>When an Ability is used against a set scenario or object (such as
using Security to pick a lock), the feat usually has a difficulty assigned by
the Storyteller. In such a Static Challenge, you may be required to risk a
Trait for a trivial task, or even be asked to bid two or more Traits for a
difficult, risky or frustrating undertaking. </p>

<p class=default>Some
Abilities can be used against an opponent instead of facilitating a regular
task. In this case, the Ability is expended to gain a retest in a challenge
with the opponent. See the rules for challenges and retests on p. 195 for
complete details.</p>

<p class=default>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><a name="#focusing_abilities">Focusing Abilities</a></h2>

<p class=default>A few
Abilities specifically require a concentrated area of study. One cannot simply
study all <i>Crafts</i> at once, after all. These Abilities are specifically
noted in the descriptions. When you take such <span class=GramE>an Ability</span>,
you must choose an area of study, a specific topic that you have concentrated
on. Each area is considered a separate Ability, so Science: Biology counts
completely separately from Science: <i>Metallurgy</i>, for instance.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><a name="_ability_specialisations">Ability Specializations</a></h2>

<p class=default>Within a
given area of expertise, some practitioners further hone their knowledge to a
razor's edge. By choosing a specialization in an Ability,
you hone your skills with a particular facet of that talent. </p>

<p class=default>Ability
specializations are a wholly optional rule. Remember to ask your Storyteller
before taking a specialization. </p>

<p class=default>Taking a
specialization requires that you spend one Experience Trait or Free Trait on an
Ability that you already have. Whenever you perform a task with that
specialization-even if you do not expend the Ability-you gain a one-Trait bonus
on resolution of challenges, as long as you have at least one level of the
Ability left. You may only have one specialization in any given Ability; you
cannot take <i>Firearms: Pistols</i> and <i>Firearms: Rifles</i> together, for
instance. You also can never gain more than one Bonus Trait at a time from
specializations, even if more than one would be appropriate to a given
challenge. That is, even if you have <i>Medicine: Physiology</i> and <i>Science:
Biology Research</i>, you only get a one-Trait bonus on a test of biochemistry,
despite your multiple specializations.</p>

<p class=default>A
specialization is a fairly narrow area of research or practice. You cannot, for
instance, take a <i>Firearms</i> specialization in &quot;guns,&quot; nor could
you have an <i>Occult</i> specialization of &quot;writing.&quot; An appropriate
specialization refers to one small class of items or to one type of practice
within the Ability, such as <i>Firearms: Antique Pistols</i> or <i>Occult:
Superstitions</i>. </p>

<p class=default>You may take
a specialization in an Ability with an area of study.
In such a case, you concentrate your research in one particular facet of that
sub-Ability, or in one application of it. Thus, you could have <i>Crafts:
Woodworking</i> with a specialization in <i>Hidden Panels</i>, or <i>Science:
Botany</i> with a specialization in <i>Exotic Flora</i>. </p>

<p class=default>Note that the
Bonus Trait from a specialization does not have an adjective, and it is not bid
or used like other Traits. You simply are &quot;one Trait up&quot; on
challenges within the specialization. </p>

<p class=default><b><i>Example:</b> Marcus won Schlagenhanz
is an experienced Brujah fighter, but he is
especially good with fencing weapons. He has the Ability: Melee x3 with the
specialization: Fencing. When Marcus engages a foe in combat, he normally uses
his 11 Physical Traits. With a fencing blade, however, he has 12 Physical
Traits because of his intense training. Of course, if he gets tired out or
wounded (loses several challenges), he may not have as many Traits, but as long
as he has at Least one level of his Melee Ability left, he gets to add the one
Bonus Trait to his remaining Physical Trait total. </i></p>

<p class=default>&nbsp;</p>

<h3><a name="_academics">Academics</a></h3>

<p class=default>You possess a
level of education and general knowledge beyond rudimentary schooling. With
Academics, you can express artistic criticism, debate the classics, consider
philosophy and indulge in studies of culture. This broad Ability covers all
sorts of humanities in learning. </p>

<p class=default>Academics allows you to recognize historical, art and cultural
references. You can use Academics when working in such fields, when developing
a critique or researching. Calling on Academics Ability may require a Mental or
Social Challenge to determine your exact level of competence. </p>

<p class=default>You may
further direct your studies by choosing a specific field, such as Art
Criticism, Classical Studies, History, .Journalism, Theology or anything else
that could be studied with higher education. </p>

<h3><a name="_animalKen">Animal Ken</a> </h3>

<p class=default>Most animals
find Kindred frightening. With Animal Ken, you have learned to understand
animals, and YOU can sometimes deal with them more equitably. Though they may
retain a healthy fear of the predator lurking within you, you know what drives
them and how to assuage their fears. </p>

<p class=default><i>Animal Ken</i> is often used with the <i>Animalism</i>
Discipline. With <i>Animal Ken</i>, you can train an animal (especially a
ghoul) into particular behaviors (stay, fetch, attack), or attempt to deduce an
animal's state of being (injured, angry, frightened, etc.) with a Mental
Challenge. If you work with an animal over a long period of
time (generally a month or so), you may be able to teach it a simple trick, up
to a limit of one trick for each Mental Trait that the animal has.</p>



<h3><a name="_athletics">Athletics</a></h3>

<p class=default>Whether due
to a background in sports or just personal talent, you are skilled in all
manner of athletic endeavors. You can throw a ball, sprint, climb, jump and swim.
This last can be especially useful to vampires, who do not naturally float. </p>

<p class=default>Your <i>Athletics</i>
Ability is used for retests on most forms of raw physical activity: acrobatics,
swimming, jumping, throwing, climbing and running. You may choose to focus on
something you do especially well.</p>

<p class=default>&nbsp;</p>

<h3><a name="_awareness">Awareness</a></h3>

<p class=default>You have a
talent for knowing when things are not as they should be, whether by that
strange feeling in the pit of our gut or through tested observation. This is
particularly useful for sensing when other supernatural creatures about,
detecting evidence of Numina or other strange
phenomena, or just getting that weird feeling when the laws of nature are about
to take a hard left. </p>

<p class=default><i>Awareness</i> requires a <i>Mental</i>
challenge to use, and retests are made with the <i>Occult</i> Ability.</p>

<p class=default>&nbsp;</p>

<h3><a name="_brawl">Brawl</a></h3>

<p class=default>Back-alleys,
martial arts schools and rough bars are your stomping ground. You might have
military training, or maybe you just grew up with a passel of rough-and-tumble
siblings. Whatever the case, you know how to dish out damage with your fists
and feet. </p>

<p class=default>Use the <i>Brawl</i>
Ability for retests in combat when you are using your natural </p>

<p class=default>weapons (teeth, claws or fists). This Ability is also the province of the martial arts,
</p>

<p class=default>although you should specify which art when taking this Ability.</p>


<h3><a name="_conputer">Computer</a></h3>

<p class=default>Most Cainites have difficulty adapting to modem inventions. As a
result, an understanding of cutting edge technology makes for dangerous
knowledge. With the Computer Ability, you understand how to use, program and
access computers of all sorts.</p>

<p class=default>Use <i>Computer</i>
with a Mental Challenge (difficulty determined by the Storyteller) to break
into systems, alter data, write programs or figure out unfamiliar operations.</p>


<h3><a name="_crafts">Crafts</a></h3>

<p class=default>You can build
things. Depending on your area of expertise, you know how to manufacture items
and make handy tools or decorations. You must choose a focus for Crafts,
specifying your form of creation: Carpentry, Clockworks, Blacksmithing,
Leatherworking and the like are all possibilities. You can fashion works of
art, studying Painting, Drawing or similar physical media. Crafts also cover
more technical skills done with labor, such as Mechanics and Electronics. </p>

<p class=default>Making or
repairing an item with Crafts usually involves a Physical Challenge of your dexterity, with difficulty set by the Storyteller based on
the type of job (making a concealed spring loaded trap is far more difficult
than planing a board, for instance). Artistic works
designed with Crafts x 3or better may entrance Toreador, at the discretion of
the Storyteller. </p>

<p class=default>The Tzimisce practice a focus of Body Crafts when using
Vicissitude. This Ability covers tattooing, piercing, flaying and all other
applications thereof regarding the alteration of the body.</p>

<p class=default>&nbsp;</p>

<h3><a name="_dodge">Dodge</a></h3>

<p class=default>When trouble
rears its ugly head, you know how to get out of its way. Unhesitating reactions
let you evade blows and shots, getting out of the way of injury. You can use
Dodge against any attack that you're aware of: diving for cover as someone
fires a gun or twisting away from a sword, for instance. <i>Dodge</i> may be
used as a retest when defending against an attack that you can see or sense
coming. </p>


<h3><a name="_drive">Drive</a></h3>

<p class=default>Though most
people can drive in the modem age, you can drive well. You're equally at home
with a stick shift or an automatic, rush hour is no concern and you can get the
most performance out of a car. In dangerous situations, you can evade traffic
and even use your vehicle as a weapon. Bear in mind that just because you can
drive a station wagon doesn't mean you can drive a semi with equal ease. A
Mental Challenge may be required to allow you to figure out where everything is
in an unfamiliar vehicle. </p>

<p class=default><i>Drive</i> tests most often involve a Physical
Challenge of your reflexes. </p>


<h3><a name="_empathy">Empathy</a></h3>

<p class=default>You are
sensitive to the moods and emotions of people around you. When YOU listen to
someone, you understand her feelings. You can identify with others and tell
when people are lying or holding back while talking to you. </p>

<p class=default>With a Social
Challenge and the expenditure of an <i>Empathy</i>
Ability, you can determine if the last thing that someone said was a lie
(although Subterfuge can defend against this expenditure). Alternately, you can
attempt to determine the subject's current Demeanor.</p>


<h3><a name="_etiquette">Etiquette</a></h3>

<p class=default>Even though
knowing which fork to use isn't as important to Kindred society, you do know
the proper way to greet someone, when to rise and how to make introductions.
You can hold a toast with the best of them, and you keep your cool in any
social scenario, from high tea to a gang's rally. </p>

<p class=default>The <i>Etiquette</i>
Ability can be used with Social Tests to impress or blend in at parties. If you
make a social <i>faux pas</i>, you may expend an Etiquette Ability immediately
to negate the gaffe -your character knew better than to make the mistake. </p>


<h3><a name="_expression">Expression</a></h3>

<p class=default>Words and
feelings flow freely from you. When the muse strikes, you put pen to paper (or
fingers to instrument) and pour out a torrent of emotion and stirring imagery.
You can convey message and meaning in your art, from symphonies to poetry, and
whatever you write is both clear and moving.</p>

<p class=default>When writing
or composing, you can sink true Expression into the work. Works created with <i>Expression</i>
x 3 or more have the potential to entrance Toreador, as per their clan
weakness. </p>

<h3><a name="_finance">Finance</a></h3>

<p class=default>The world of
money and business awaits your whim. You understand interest, CDs, stock market
transactions, currency exchanges and GNPs. A little <i>Finance</i> lets you
make quite a bit of money. You can also use your Finance to balance books or
run a business of your own.</p>

<p class=default>Typically,
you can run a business, follow a money trail, perform an audit or clean up an
accounting mess with a Mental Challenge (difficulty dependent on the task, as
determined by the Storyteller). Alternately, you can expend a level of <i>Finance</i>
Ability to raise $250 in cash between games. Not every use of Finance is so
benign -money laundering operations have to come from somewhere. </p>

<h3><a name="_firearms">Firearms</a></h3>

<p class=default>A little time
at the gun range goes a long way. You know how to hold,
fire and clean a <i>gun. </i>You can unjam one, too,
and you can tell different models apart. You know how to stand to get the best
aim, how to handle recoil and how to take care of problems in the field.</p>

<p class=default>If you
possess the <i>Firearms</i> Ability, you may use your Mental Traits for gun
combat instead of using Physical Traits, at no cost. You can expend <i>Firearms</i>
for a retest in ranged-fire combat. </p>

<h3><a name="_Toc68354491">Hobby/Professional/Expert Ability</a></h3>

<p class=default>In a certain
area of expertise not covered by another Ability, you
have achieved some level of skill. You may have a small grasp of a trade due to
some work on the side, or perhaps you've specifically studied a topic. </p>

<p class=default><i>Hobby/Professional/Expert Ability</i> is a
catch-all category for highly unusual Abilities like Cainite
Lore, Thanatology, Demolitions
and so on. Any Ability of this type must be specifically approved by the
Storyteller, and it has its capabilities defined by the Storyteller. </p>

<h3><a name="_intimidation">Intimidation</a></h3>

<p class=default>Intimidation
represents any of a broad variety of techniques for terrifying people into
compliance. This could be anything from physical size, to a particularly
frightening grin, to knowing which emotional buttons to push. </p>

<p class=default>You can use <i>Intimidation</i>
when trying to scare someone with a Social Challenge, or with certain
Disciplines. </p>

<h3><a name="_investigation">Investigation</a></h3>

<p class=default>You know how
to pickup clues and put together disparate pieces of information. By habit and
training, you can set a jumbled mass of data into order, discovering
identities, motives and patterns in an otherwise chaotic scene. You can use <i>Investigation</i>
with a Mental Challenge when trying to puzzle out meaning to a random scene, or
with most Auspex Discipline powers. </p>

<h3><a name="_law">Law</a></h3>

<p class=default>Nobody is
above the law, except those who know how to use it to their own advantage.
You're one of the latter. Perhaps you uphold the law, or maybe you twist it to
your own ends. Your knowledge of Law allows you to understand legal processes,
courts and lawyers, and to use them effectively. </p>

<p class=default>Use the <i>Law</i>Ability in court situations or with
Social Challenges involving legal matters. Because the legal body is so vast,
your Storyteller may require you to select a particular area of study
(Criminal, Civil, Tax, etc.). Alternately, you may choose to study Kindred law
in depth. </p>

<h3><a name="_leadership">Leadership</a></h3>

<p class=default>When you
speak, people listen. A good speaking voice and self-confidence lend a powerful
presence to a leader. The Leadership Ability represents your ability to
motivate people and to get them to follow your guidance. Even among those who
do not know or respect you, you can demand attention. </p>

<p class=default>You can use <i>Leadership</i>
with a Social Challenge to try to get a minor favor or task from a character.
Leadership is also used with many Presence powers. </p>

<h3><a name="_linguistics">Linguistics</a></h3>

<p class=default>You've
studied a language -or languages -other than your native tongue. Whether you're
an older vampire whose childhood language is no longer spoken, you frequent the
global community, or it is necessary for other studies, you can speak, write
and read other languages. </p>

<p class=default>You must
choose one language for each level of Linguistics you possess. Thus, you could
have Linguistics: Cantonese and Linguistics: German. Alternately, you can focus
on the underlying study of Linguistics itself, granting some understanding of
the principles behind the structure of language. Languages need not be spoken;
American Sign Language or Egyptian hieroglyphics would also be considered
fields for study. Those who wish to converse in another language (but cannot
actually do so) should hold up one hand with the first finger and thumb making
an L-shape to indicate to other players the characters are not speaking
English. Those who wish to listen in must also possess the language. </p>

<h3><a name="_medicine">Medicine</a></h3>

<p class=default>You know how
the human (and, to a lesser extent, Cainite) body
functions. You can speed the recovery and healing of an injured mortal, or you
can use your knowledge to inflict injury. Many Cainites
learn just enough to know where to bite their victims or how to punish their
ghouls. </p>

<p class=default>You can use
the <i>Medicine</i> Ability to speed a mortal's healing by one category: a <i>Wounded</i> mortal
would heal as if Bruised, for instance. Medicine may be used for other sorts of
research and lab work with a Mental Challenge. As Medicine represents such a
vast field, your Storyteller may require you to specify what you know
(Pharmaceuticals, Internal Medicine, General
Practice). </p>

<h3><a name="_melee">Melee</a></h3>

<p class=default>If you've got
something in your hands, you're a deadly fighter. Be it a sword, a stick or a
set of nunchaku, you can use it to damaging effect.
Expend <i>Melee</i> for retests in hand-to-hand combat when you are using a
close combat weapon like a knife or a chair. Certain weapons function best when
wielded by a character with Melee. </p>

<h3><a name="_occult">Occult</a></h3>

<p class=default>The hidden
world teems with mysterious secrets. By unlocking universal keys and studying
the basics of spirituality, you can learn the shadowy paths of the cosmos. Your
Occult Ability serves as a general knowledge of the supernatural, alerting you
to the existence of many varied sorts of inhuman creatures and paranormal
events.</p>

<p class=default>Some
Disciplines, most notably Thaumaturgy, rely on the occult Ability. Occult
grants some basic (and sometimes erroneous) knowledge of the various denizens
of the supernatural world; for more detailed information, study <i>Expert
Ability</i>: Lore in your particular subject of interest.</p>

<h3><a name="_performance">Performance</a></h3>

<p class=default>You are a
true virtuoso. Whatever you’re chosen medium, you have a gift for artistic endeavors.
Whether playing an instrument, singing, dancing or acting, your skills allow
you to entertain and even earn money.</p>

<p class=default>Your <i>Performance</i>
Ability can be used to earn a modest income, just like other artistic trade
skills. If you execute a work with Performance x 3 or better, you may transfix
Toreador in the area with the beauty and grace of your style. </p>

<p class=default>You must
choose a specific art form when you take Performance, such as playing an
instrument, singing, acting or dramatic readings. Note that Performance is
generally anything done before an audience, while Expression most often focuses
on literary works, and crafts concentrates on the creation of physical objects
(such as paintings or sculptures). </p>

<h3><a name="_politics">Politics</a></h3>

<p class=default>The world of
influence-trading and favors is extensive enough among mortals. In vampire
society, where one's prowess is measured in standing with one's peers, the game
of Politics is all-consuming. Through observation, intrigue and a bit of spin
doctoring, you've learned how to handle appearances, what a speech really
means, and where the deal-making is going on. In short, it's Politics as usual.
</p>

<p class=default>The <i>Politics</i>
Ability is useful primarily in dealings with mortal society or Influence. You
may be able to manipulate the outcome of local political actions, with the
proper Influence and some well-placed Social Challenges; Politics Ability
ensures that matters proceed in the direction that you desire. Politics is also
used to discern hidden motives and broker deals, and as such, it is almost a
requirement of any harpy. With Politics, you can usually set an appropriate
level of debt for a prestation boon. The hierarchies
of power are often obvious to you, granting you insight into whether the prince
is really in charge, or is simply a puppet of the primogen,
for example. Politics also makes you aware of who's in favor and who's out, and
you can determine how much Status a particular vampire possesses once
introduced. (If you know your quarry's name, expend a Politics Ability to
determine the subject's Status Traits.)</p>

<p class=default>A Knowledge
of Politics includes, by extension, an understanding of the bureaucratic levels
of power. You know how to cut through red tape, or how to obstruct others with
it. By determining who's important in a given strata, you can usually avoid
wasting time and simply go straight to the person with the power to do what you
want. </p>

<h3><a name="_repair">Repair</a></h3>

<p class=default>You possess a
working understanding of what makes things tick. With times, tools and parts,
you can fix or slightly alter most of the trappings of modern society. This
knowledge also allows you to excel at sabotage. The Repair Ability is
widespread among inventors, mechanics and handymen. Using this Ability usually
calls for a Mental Challenge, the difficulty of which depends on such factors
as the item's complexity, tools and parts available, extent of damage and time
spent on the repairs. </p>

<h3><a name="_science">Science</a></h3>

<p class=default>The modern
Information Age sees the explosion of all manner of studies. Categorizing and
breaking down the world into many different forms, the methods of logic and
reason give sentient beings the means to understand the universe, or at least
small pieces of it. Education in Science covers techniques of inquiry, modern
studies and a broad range of underpinning work in a diverse range of fields. </p>

<p class=default><i>Science</i> Ability requires an area of
particular study: Biology, Chemistry, Physics, Metallurgy, Electrical
Engineering, Mathematics, Geology and Botany are all possibilities, though such
a list is far from comprehensive. Combining a Science with different fields may
give a wide variety results. For example, Science: Metallurgy with Academics
may give results regarding historical research and theory, while the same
Science with Occult may centre on ancient alchemy or parapsychology. Actually
constructing objects or devices theorized with Science may require use of the
Crafts Ability. </p>

<p class=default>Using a
particular branch of Science usually requires a Mental Challenge of some sort
to determine the success of research or the viability of theoretical work. </p>

<h3><a name="_security">Security</a></h3>

<p class=default>Whichever
side of the law you've worked on has granted you experience in Security techniques.
You know about police operations and guard work, how they make their schedules
and how they undertake their business - and how to disrupt such operations.
Locks, traps, security systems and alarms are all within your purview. With a
little time, you can put together Security measures for a location; you can
also defeat such measures. </p>

<p class=default>Use the <i>Security</i>
Ability with Mental Traits to set up a secure area or network, or to formulate
a plan for breaching such a network. Security Ability is also used to disarm
traps, alarms and other devices, and to defeat locks. At the discretion of a
Narrator, you may be required to use a Physical Trait related to dexterity when
attempting to bypass a physical lock or alarm. </p>

<h3><a name="_scrounge">Scrounge</a></h3>

<p class=default>You're
exceptionally good at finding stuff. Whether it's a crucial part for a 1890s' gramophone,
invitations to the most exclusive gallery opening in town, or just haven space
in the downtown, you're a wiz at knowing where to go, who to talk to and how to
get what you need. Granted, the things you get are rarely brand-new or exactly
right and do take time and favors to acquire. Still such an
ability is useful when your finances are less than sparkling or theft is
out of the question.</p>

<p class=default><i>Scrounge</i> is typically used in conjunction
with Mental Traits (although the Storyteller may occasionally require a Social
Challenge for haggling), and can be useful when looking for particular items or
searching a place that is in shambles. </p>

<h3><a name="_stealth">Stealth</a></h3>

<p class=default>By blending
into cover, blurring your lines and moving carefully and quietly, you can evade
notice or sneak past people. You know how best to take advantage of surrounding
cover and how to use light and shadow. Opportunities for unnoticed movement are
not lost on you, as you understand the uses of timing and diversion. </p>

<p class=default>With an
appropriate Physical Challenge, you can sometimes sneak past the notice of
guards and searchers (who contest your Ability with their Mental Traits and
investigation Ability). You also use <i>Stealth</i> to augment the <i>Obfuscate
Discipline</i>. </p>

<h3><a name="_streetwise">Streetwise</a></h3>

<p class=default>Word on the
street is known to you. Even if you don't have any particular friends or
contacts in the area, you know about the different communities and gangs that
hang out in town. You recognize tagging and other territorial markers, and you
know some of the signs, colors and clothes that denote street people, homeless,
gang bangers, hoodlums, criminals and social workers. </p>

<p class=default>Using the <i>Streetwise</i>
Ability, with your Mental Traits, lets you recognize the influence of various
gangs or street communities. You also know about criminal organizations and
activities, and you could perform a little larceny yourself. An appropriate
Social Challenge can help smooth dealings with a hostile gang (though you may
need Etiquette to make a really good impression). </p>

<h3><a name="_subterfuge">Subterfuge</a></h3>

<p class=default>There are
many ways to talk about subjects, and equally many ways to uncover the truth of
the matter. Even in idle conversation, people use little white lies, slip hints
about their true motives, try to guide the course of discussion and give away
their secrets indirectly. The art of Subterfuge is the art of reading these
tricks and using them effortlessly. </p>

<p class=default>When someone
confronts you with one of your lies, you can use the <i>Subterfuge</i> Ability
in your own defense (if someone uses the Empathy Ability, for instance). By
guiding a conversation, you can also unearth someone's Negative Traits; if you
manage to steer conversation to a particular topic in play, you can expend
a <i>Subterfuge</i>Ability and make a Social Challenge to
determine one of the subject's Negative Traits related to the topic. Furthermore,
because it deals in deceit and subversion, Subterfuge is used for retests with
the Chimerstry Discipline.</p>

<h3><a name="_survival">Survival</a></h3>

<p class=default><i>Survival</i> Ability represents knowledge of
terrain, how to find shelter, where to find water, techniques in hunting,
edible and poisonous plants and fungi and so on. Though a vampire needs only
blood to live, use of Survival makes hunting of animals much easier, and it
provides some assurances of a safer existence for those who travel outside the
cities.</p>

<p class=default>Hunting and
avoiding danger in the wilderness usually relies on a Physical Challenge. With <i>Survival</i>,
you can substitute your Mental Traits if you so desire. <i>Survival</i> is also
a measure of the character's ruggedness and ability to overcome obstacles and
injury, so it can be used in retests of the Fortitude and Protean Disciplines.</p>

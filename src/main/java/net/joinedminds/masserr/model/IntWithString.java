	 * Returns a string representation of the object. In general, the
	 * <code>toString</code> method returns a string that
	 * "textually represents" this object. The result should
	 * be a concise but informative representation that is easy for a
	 * person to read.
	 * It is recommended that all subclasses override this method.
	 * <p>
	 * The <code>toString</code> method for class <code>Object</code>
	 * returns a string consisting of the name of the class of which the
	 * object is an instance, the at-sign character `<code>@</code>', and
	 * the unsigned hexadecimal representation of the hash code of the
	 * object. In other words, this method returns a string equal to the
	 * value of:
	 * <blockquote>
	 * <pre>
	 * getClass().getName() + '@' + Integer.toHexString(hashCode())
	 * </pre></blockquote>
	 *
	 * @return  a string representation of the object.
